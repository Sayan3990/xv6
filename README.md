    xv6 is a teaching operating system developed in 2006 for MIT's operating systems course, Operating System Engineering. As, it is a fresh operating system, you can do several projects in the xv6 environment that will be helpful to achieve a clear knowledge of how the system calls are working and how the Operating System is managing everything. xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6, but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C. </p>

<p>   In my repository, you will be getting small projects and way of making system calls in xv6 that I have done during my Operating System course in BTech Computer science and engineering.<br>
Hope it will be helpful.</p>

<h3>BUILDING AND RUNNING xv6</h3>

<p>   To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run "make".
On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you will
need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing x86 ELF
binaries.  See http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/tools.html. </p>
<h4>To run xv6, install the QEMU PC simulators.  To run in QEMU, run "make qemu".</h4>
