XV6 is a teaching operating system developed in 2006 for MIT's operating systems course, Operating System Engineering. As, it is a fresh operating system, you can do several projects in the xv6 environment that will be helpful to achieve a clear knowledge of how the system calls are working and how the Operating System is managing everything.</p>

<p>In my repository, you will be getting small projects and way of making system calls in xv6 that I have done during my BTech in Computer science and engineering.<br>
Hope it will be helpful.</p>
<h3>Thank you.</h3>
